# v2.2.7

Release date: 2026-02-06

## Highlights

- Node runtime hardening for path safety and validation consistency.
- Cross-interface output behavior aligned around envelope semantics.
- CLI/MCP/HTTP and composition behaviors tightened for predictable contracts.

## Clarification

`compose --trace` remains a trace/debug wrapper output mode.
It is intentionally different from pure envelope output used in non-trace mode.

## Distribution

- npm: `cognitive-modules-cli@2.2.7` and `cogn@2.2.7`
- PyPI (legacy): `cognitive-modules@2.2.3`

## Package Changelogs

- `packages/cli-node/CHANGELOG.md`
- `packages/cogn/CHANGELOG.md`
