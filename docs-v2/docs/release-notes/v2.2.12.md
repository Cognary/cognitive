# v2.2.12

Release date: 2026-02-08

## Highlights

- Conformance: add `runtime` suite (offline, deterministic vectors) to validate publish-grade parsing behavior and profile gates (`core/standard/certified`).
- Docs: clarify provider capabilities, structured-output downgrade rules (native -> prompt), and where the runtime records decisions (`meta.policy.*`).
