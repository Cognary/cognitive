# v2.2.9

Release date: 2026-02-07

## Highlights

- Fix: `cog core run` now prints a proper v2.2 error envelope on failures (instead of `Error: undefined`).
- Packaging: add stable `bin.js` entrypoint so publish/install does not depend on prebuilt `dist/` being present.
- Core: align stdin-core placeholders with runtime substitution and treat missing inputs as empty (`query`/`code`).
